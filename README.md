# demo-gamehub

A minimal RAWG.io clone made in React that uses RAWG api, built using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

This project was developed following the [React for Beginners](https://codewithmosh.com/p/ultimate-react-part1) tutorial, making also some changes and personalizations.
