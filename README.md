# demo-gamehub

A minimal RAWG.io clone made in React that uses RAWG api, built using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - library for web and native user interfaces
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - fast frontend build tool
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - superset of JavaScript that adds types
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - modular UI component library for React
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - react library for animation and motion graphics
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - JavaScript library for making HTTP requests

This project was developed following the [React for Beginners](https://codewithmosh.com/p/ultimate-react-part1) tutorial, making also some changes and personalizations.
